1. Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.

2. Write the function that hit the API. You're going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the info.

3. Write the functions that process the JSON data you're getting from the API and return and object with only the data you require for your app.

4. Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

5. Display the info on the webpage.

6. Add styling.

8. Optional: Add a 'loading' component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the info comes back from the API.

8. Push to GitHub.
